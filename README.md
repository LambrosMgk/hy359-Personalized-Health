This is the project of class hy359 of UOC Computer Science Department.

Goal : 
  You are invited to design and develop an online information system, named personalized-health. 
  The goal of the information system is to allow users to monitor and improve their health, but also to give doctors an original way to communicate with patients,
  and allow them to arrange appointments, read their history, to compare patient examinations through visualizations, etc.

I used XAMPP for my database in this project and apache-tomcat-9.0.56 for the host.
